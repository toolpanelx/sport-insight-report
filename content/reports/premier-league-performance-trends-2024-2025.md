1. Overview of the 2024-25 Premier League season

The 2024-2025 Premier League season delivered one of the most analytically rich campaigns in recent years. Expected Goals (xG), shot quality metrics, possession structures and pressing intensity highlighted clear patterns across the league – especially among Liverpool, Arsenal and the rising mid-table analytics darlings (Bournemouth, Brentford, Aston Villa).

This report summarises the key performance indicators, data-driven insights and emerging tactical trends of the season.

2. League-wide performance metrics
2.1 Team Expected Goals (xG) Table
Rank	Team	Total xG	Trend
1	Liverpool	Highest in league	Consistently elite chance creation
2	Arsenal	Very high xG	Strong structural attack
3	Bournemouth	Surprisingly high	Outperformed traditional expectations
4	Aston Villa	Mid-high xG	Direct but effective chance generation
5	Brentford	Stable xG engine	Good shot locations

Insight:
Liverpool separated themselves statistically by generating the league’s best quality chances across the season, validating their aggressive positional play and quick-transition system.

2.2 Top Defensive Metrics (xGA – Expected Goals Against)
Rank	Team	xGA (lower = better)	Trend
1	Arsenal	Lowest in league	Rigid block + elite pressing trap
2	Manchester City	Very low	Control-based defensive model
3	Liverpool	Low	High-energy counter-press
4	Newcastle United	Mid-low	Strong box protection
5	Manchester United	High	Overexposure in defensive transitions

Insight:
Arsenal’s defensive structure was the best in the league. United and Chelsea were statistical underachievers defensively, often conceding high-quality chances despite decent possession numbers.

2.3 xG Differential Table (xG - xGA)

(The most accurate predictor of long-term success)

Rank	Team	xG Diff	Interpretation
1	Liverpool	Best in league	Title-challenger profile
2	Arsenal	Close second	Balanced dominance
3	Manchester City	Slight decline	Fewer high-quality shots created
4	Aston Villa	Positive	Clear upward trend
5	Tottenham	Mild positive	High variance pressing model
3. Individual Player Performance Trends
3.1 xG + xA Leaders (Combined Expected Goals + Assists)
Rank	Player	Club	xG + xA	Interpretation
1	Mohamed Salah	Liverpool	~35	Still elite-level chance generator
2	Erling Haaland	Man City	High	Volume shooter, but less efficient year
3	Bukayo Saka	Arsenal	High	More involved in build-up and scoring
4	Dominic Solanke	Bournemouth	High	Breakout season
5	Ollie Watkins	Aston Villa	Consistent	Strong hybrid forward

Key takeaway:
Salah’s xG+xA dominance shows he remains Liverpool’s central attacking engine. Solanke and Watkins highlight the rise of forwards outside the traditional Big Six.

3.2 Overperformers vs Underperformers (Finishing)
Overperformers
Player	Club	Goals vs xG	Trend
Son Heung-min	Tottenham	Goals > xG	Elite finisher, high shot efficiency
Jarrod Bowen	West Ham	Goals > xG	Excellent counter-attacking output
Underperformers
Player	Club	Goals vs xG	Trend
Darwin Núñez	Liverpool	Goals < xG	High-volume, low-conversion
Nicolas Jackson	Chelsea	Goals < xG	Shot selection issues
4. Tactical Trends of the Season
4.1 Liverpool – The xG Machine

High-tempo vertical attacks

Improved midfield structure

Numerous high-value shots inside the box

Salah central to creation and finishing

Their issue remained converting periods of dominance into goals.

4.3 Bournemouth & Villa – Data-driven success stories

High xG relative to squad value

Well-structured transitional attacks

Successful use of analytics in recruitment

Strikers outperforming expected metrics

These sides exemplified "smart recruitment + tactical clarity".

5. Momentum and Form Trends (2024–2025)
Teams trending upward:

Aston Villa – stable positive momentum

Liverpool – strongest xG profile

Bournemouth – analytics-favourite outperformer

Teams trending downward:

Chelsea – chance creation inconsistent

Manchester United – high xGA and poor match control
